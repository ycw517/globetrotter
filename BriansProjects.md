# Brian's Projects #

Here are projects I completed in [ECE194](http://cadlab.ece.ucsb.edu/ece194/) (Winter 2011)

## Homework 1: Photo Switcher ##
  * [YouTube Demonstration](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJjEvwy8yDc)

  1. Write an application to display your name and photo. Run this application either on the emulator or an Android device.
  1. Application framework: Intent. Extend the application of part (2) to two activities, and then use Intent to communicate between these two activities.
> Add a button "change picture" in your layout. When this button is pressed, it activates the second activity. In the second activity, allow the user to choose a picture from a set of pictures. When the user presses the button "pick" in this second activity, it returns the chosen picture to the first activity which in turn displays the returned picture.

## Homework 2: Lunar Lander ##
  * [YouTube Demonstration](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPiuvESpVaA)

  1. Extend the Lunar Lander application to respond to the device's orientation. Create asteroids and a landing pad. Navigate through the asteroids and land the lunar lander safely. Missing the landing pad or hitting an asteroid results in a crash. In addition, implement:
    * Tap to start
    * Shake to restart
    * Tilt to control

## Homework 3: JDK and OpenGL ##

### Part 1: JDK ###
  * [YouTube Demonstration (JDK)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqsTvg2x5mk)

  1. Create a medical imaging viewer (for 181 MRI slices of a brain) with Rician Denoising capabilities by calling a native function (written in C) by  [Pascal Getreuer](http://www.math.ucla.edu/~getreuer/) for Rician Denoising using the Java Native Interface.

### Part 2: OpenGL 1.0 ###
  * [YouTube Demonstration (OpenGL 1.0)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbdX9APbqK4)

  1. Create a 3D cube with different colored faces and rotate it such that 3 of the faces can be seen. Add buttons to a menu and implement the following functions:
    * Zoom In
    * Zoom Out
    * Translate (on the x axis)
    * Apply a texture to the top face of the cube
