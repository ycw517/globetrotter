_Geotagging the world with panoramas_

Welcome to the online home of our ECE 194BB final project, GlobeTrotter. Below we will post updates as we make progress on our project.

The main goal of the project is to (via a mobile phone camera) capture a 360 degree panorama, sample the video for still images, send those images to a server to be stitched, retrieve those images, and then display the panorama. We will also incorporate geo-tagging data along with the image so that it can be plotted on a map. We will allow any visitor to view any location (provided it has been tagged as public), as well as submit their own location.
